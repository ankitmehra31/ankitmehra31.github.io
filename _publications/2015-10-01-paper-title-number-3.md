excerpt: 'In this paper, we have explored various control strategies for an AGV and UAV collaborative system. Our work focuses on developing a vision-based localization and control method for the AGV. We introduced four distinct control strategies: PID control, SMC, DQN based control, and DDPG based control, aimed at achieving continuous tracking of the UAV.
We conducted a comprehensive comparison of these controllers across multiple parameters, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Everything was experimentally validated.'
