permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'This work develops a method for the vision-based localization and control of a UAV in firefighting situations. Detection of fire is done using a deep learning technique Precise 3-D cartesian coordinates of the centroid of fire is obtained using onboard sensors, contributing to the localization of fire. A PID based control strategy is developed for continuous tracking of fire and also maintaining a particular distance from the fire for ensuring accurate spraying. Additionally, the performance of the spraying subassembly has been independently verified.'
