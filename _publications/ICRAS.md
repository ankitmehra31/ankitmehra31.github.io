excerpt: 'This paper presents the autonomous vision-based control of an aerial manipulator for tracking horizontal pipe structures along with maintaining continuous contact with the pipe. We have designed a perception module that consists of custom made CNN with classical vision technique for pipe identification along with feature and Kalman filter for increasing data frequency. The sensor fusion of the camera and LIDAR is used to extract the cartesian coordinate of an approximate contact point. The new manipulator has been fabricated along with the development of its feed-forward position control. The image feature-based tracking control of the aerial platform is developed with a sliding mode controller. The autonomous operation strategy to organize the sub-tasks is developed and experimentally validated.'

Continuous health monitoring of industrial pipelines, railway tracks, and powerline-like horizontal structures is crucial for ensuring human safety. Recently, the aerial manipulator concept is getting more attention for the contact inspection of industrial structures. This paper proposed the autonomous vision-based control of an aerial manipulator for tracking of horizontal pipe structure while maintaining continuous contact by a manipulator. The perception module of the proposed approach includes a deep learning technique for pipe identification in the image, a classical vision for feature extraction, and a Kalman filter to resolve the data latency problem in real time. The integration of LIDAR and the camera sensor has been used to extract the cartesian coordinate of the approximate contact point. The manipulator is designed and developed along with inverse kinematics to maintain
continuous contact with the pipe. Image-based sliding mode controller is used for lateral and yaw orientation control of the aerial platform. The altitude control is done using a LIDAR sensor. The novel forward velocity function is introduced which serves the purpose of smooth tracking along with maintaining a pipe in the reachable space of the manipulator. The fully autonomous operation strategy has been designed to organize subtasks sequentially with feedback. During the tracking of a pipeline, the lateral position and altitude position with respect to manipulator’s base did not deviate beyond ± 0.2m. Fully autonomous vision-based control of aerial manipulator has been validated experimentally on a 10-meter long pipeine.
