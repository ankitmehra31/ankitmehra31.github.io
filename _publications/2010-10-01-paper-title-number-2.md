permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper presents the autonomous vision-based control of an aerial manipulator for tracking horizontal pipe structures along with maintaining continuous contact with the pipe. We have designed a perception module that consists of custom made CNN with classical vision technique for pipe identification along with feature and Kalman filter for increasing data frequency. The sensor fusion of the camera and LIDAR is used to extract the cartesian coordinate of an approximate contact point. The new manipulator has been fabricated along with the development of its feed-forward position control. The image feature-based tracking control of the aerial platform is developed with a sliding mode controller. The autonomous operation strategy to organize the sub-tasks is developed and experimentally validated.'
