👨🏻‍💻 I'm a research scholar at the IIT Mandi.

🔬 My research interests are in Robotics, Control systems, Reinforcement learning and Vision based control!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Hetrogeneous multi-agent collaborative systems.


# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Project   Contributions
I have contribute to multiple projects in my lab 
[Vision based control for autonomous firefighting](https://github.com/ankitmehra31/Vision-based-control-of-firefighting-UAV). Developed control algorithm for a UAV to maneuver autonomously based on visual and distance sensor.
[Design and development of a Quadruped Robot](https://github.com/ankitmehra31/Quadruped_Robot). Designed a quadruped robot from scratch, wrote forward and inverse kinematics for the same.
[Hetrogeneous multi agent collaborative system](https://github.com/ankitmehra31/AGV-UAV-Collaboration). Developed control algorithms for UAV tracking an AGV. Compared PID,SMC and RL(DQN,DDPG) based control strategies for the same.
Moreover, I have also published papers in respective conferences[ICCAE](https://ankitmehra31.github.io/publication/ICCAE),[ICRAS](https://ankitmehra31.github.io/publication/ICRAS) and [ACC](https://ankitmehra31.github.io/publication/ACC).

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent and collaborative research.I have implemented several research papers. I have worked and published papers with my collegues [here](https://ankitmehra31.github.io/publication/ICRAS).


## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Drone Lab at IIT Mandi under the supervision of Dr. Amit Shukla working on **Multi-agent collaborative systems**.

## 📚 Teaching Contributions
I have worked as a teaching assistant in several courses during my masters tenure.
