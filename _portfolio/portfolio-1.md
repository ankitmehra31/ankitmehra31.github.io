In this project i have implemented PID, SMC, DQN, DDPG based controller for an AGV tracking a UAV using visual feedback. I have created a [custom env](/images/Custom_env.png) for training of the Reinfocement learning based controllers. I have implemented and verified the controllers on real hardware. This work is submitted in [ACC 2025](https://ankitmehra31.github.io/publications/ACC) and the code for this work can be found [here](https://github.com/ankitmehra31/AGV-UAV-Collaboration).
