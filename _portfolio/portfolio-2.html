In this project i have implemented vision based control strategy. I have created a custom dataset for training of the detection model. I have implemented and verified the controller in real hardware. This work is published in [ICCAE 2024](https://ankitmehra31.github.io/publication/ICCAE) and the code for this work can be found [here](https://github.com/ankitmehra31/Vision-based-control-of-firefighting-UAV).
